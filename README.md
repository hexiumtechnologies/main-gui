## ðŸ’» Hexium - main-gui
This repository exists for most of the website pages, excluding pages like the forums. Commit names may include light-hearted jokes and/or swearing as we see coding as a fun way to build projects. It is not recommended to put this repo on your resume.

### ðŸ’« Contributions
Wish to contribute? We welcome contributions! We highly recommend seeing `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` for contribution guidelines and how to contribute. Thanks for your time!

### ðŸ’¾ Backend
We don't keep our backend code open source because it would lead to many issues, and make it easier for vulnerabilities to be found. All site-related issues (including backend) can be reported here as an issue. We take privacy very seriously.
